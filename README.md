1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   - Client: The Gaming Room.
   - The Gaming Room wishes to design a video game titled Draw It or Lose It that is playable on another operating platform then the one the game is currently on, Android.
   - The game will need to be able to have one or multiple teams, each team consisting of multiple players. Team names must be able to be checked to make sure there are not 
     already in use by another team. There must only be one instance of the game existing in memory at a time, which can be done my assuring there are unique identifiers for the
     teams, players, and each instance of a game.
   - The client would like to ensure internet security, efficient memory management, and establish a budget for development tools and resources.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   - I think I did pretty well in the development requirements chart and the recommendations section.
   - I learned a lot about the different operating platforms that I've never thought about before. I have only every used my iPhone device on iOS and Windows on computers, and I
     never thought about the differences between those operating platforms, let alone MacOS or Linux.
   - The recommendation section allowed me to learn even more. I did a lot of research throught the web and looked into topics I never knew existed. This helped me to see just
     how much I can still learn in the future, but I now feel like I have a greater understanding of operating systems as a base for more learning. After my research, I was able
     to determine my opinion of the best one for the client, which was Windows. Linux was a close second with its better security even if there is a lesser client base. I can
     see one day that Linux might surpass Windows however.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   - The design document felt like a good layout of goals that helped in the code development process. It was like having a roadmap to refer to when making the actual game, which 
     is always very helpful in any project I'm doing.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   - I think it would have to be design constraints section. I feel like that is the section I knew the least about since there is a lot that goes into the workings of a
     business, and even more to think about when two businesses are working together. I did my best with what I could find, but I feel like I didn't know exactly what
     information I was looking for at times. I feel like that list of constraints could possibly be much longer, but at the same time, we can't of course
     know every single thing about the imaginary client in a school project. This section did give me a lot new ideas to consider when it comes to designing software though.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   - First of all, any business should want to provide the product that the client is looking for. Otherwise, that is just bad business, and you won't be getting paid well
     or possibly getting any new clients. Aside from the obvious, you should want your product to align with the needs of the client so you can be assured that there is a budget
     available, development tools available, and anything else you need to be sucessfull. It's always good to have a plan before you begin something big, and that's what a design
     document is for. The client wanted to consider cost, so I learned of cloud servers which can be much more affordable than traditional servers. I also knew the client wanted
     a game that could be playable by many people, and show the users hundreds of photos in high definition. For this project to be sucessfull, it was clear that good memory
     and storage would be a must. Security was also a priority, so it would also be important to implement good security measures. Ignoring anything on the design document here
     could lead to a failed business exchange.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   - There's a lot here I learned going through each section of the design document. Specifically, in the future I would like to use my new knowledge of storage and memory
     management techniques, and security techniques as these are commonly important for game companies. Also, my new knowledge on possibly design constraints for a company.
     There's a lot more to consider throughout the entire design document that I had originally imagined, and I would like to in the future be able to add a lot
     more information to each section.
